## Setup

The party has responded to a call for reinforcements by the Nightwatch, which they saw at the Shaking Wood Tavern, an rough-and-tumble establishment in the Market Square district of Iskander. The pay is fair, but the work unusual - patrolling the streets of the Market Square. Can the Nightwatch no longer see to their own affairs?





## Scene 1

**Chaos**: 5  
**Setup**: At night, the party patrols the streets around Market Square.  
**Altered**: At night, the party patrols the streets just off the Market Square.  
**What's fun about this scene**: Perhaps a combat encounter?  

    For this section, I'll create encounter tables similar to the ones in the
    Deadsnows campaign. In this campaign, I made encounter tables for terrain
    and for a descriptor or tag, which would then combine, for example,
    corrupted mountains or webbed forest. There were also different encounter
    tables for features, dangers and denizens, which I could combine. I'll make
    similar tables for this campaign. A result of 2-6 indicates a "Market
    Square (Night)" encounter, while 7-10 indicates a "Demonic" encounter.

    d4+d6 Features
    2     A place of evening entertainment
    3     Abandoned or ruined dwelling or market stall
    4     Injured denizen
    5     Dark alleys
    6     Detritus
    7     A distant scream
    8     Abrupt change in environment
    9     Visions of hell
    10    Implements of torture

    d4+d6 Dangers
    2     Hidden sewer entrance
    3     Denizens mustering
    4     A carriage travelling at full speed through the streets
    5     Denizens spoiling for a fight
    6     Denizens patrolling
    7     Foul weather
    8     Corrupted denizens
    9     Dark secrets best left uncovered
    10    Balls of fire hurtling from above

    d4+d6 Denizens
    2     1d6 zombies
    3     1d8 bandits
    4     1d4 members of the Nightwatch (guards)
    5     1d4+2 swarms of bats
    6     1d6+2 swarms of rats
    7     1d6 abyssal rats
    8     1d4+2 manes
    9     1d4 dretches
    10    1d4 quasits

    I'll need a procedure to determine what the PCs encounter. Once every
    three hours (that's four times a night) I'll roll a d10 and add one per
    night they've been patrolling:

    1d10+N Result
    1-3    Nothing
    4-6    Feature
    7-10   Danger
    11-12  Feature + Danger
    13-15  Feature + Denizen
    16-18  Danger + Denizen
    19-20  Goal

    Each hero earns 10gp for per night they patrol.

    Let's see what they encounter on the first night. First roll is a 9. They
    encounter a danger. 3. Denizens mustering. Roll on denizens table. 1d4
    members of the Nightwatch.

Barely has the group been together for 10 minutes when they see approaching them a group of Nightwatch guards. They can tell the guards are going to be a problem.

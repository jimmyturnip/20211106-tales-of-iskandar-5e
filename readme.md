# Campaign Template

## Concept

Pitch this game. At a high-level, whatâ€™s it about? Remember that the game might last longer if:

- The setting has a clear, simple concept
- The rule system is elegant and cohesive
- Character generation includes narrative elements
- Scene generation systems yield fun results

> A group of heroes must stop an abyssal invasion into the city of Iskandar. Will they find the source of the infestation? Can they battle the denizens that spill forth? Or is the City of Lights doomed to fall to the coming demonic horde?

## Aim

Explain what you are trying to accomplish. What is the end goal? Are we trying to tell a specific type of story? The game might last longer if:

- You have time to devote to it - short, swift bursts
- It's not just the next shiny, but something you really want to play long-term
- There's a clear vision for the game - don't rely too heavily on randomisers
- There's an achieveable endpoint, such as "7 sessions" or "when the group arrives at their destination"

> The game will continue until the heroes can close the portal to the Abyss.

## Tone

Make a note about the tone of the game. What is the default? Are there different options for gameplay (Serious vs. Gonzo, Action vs. Drama, etc.)?

> Action and investigation, some mild horror elements.

## Solo Gaming

What novel factors will this campaign bring in? What procedures will you use for generating content, such as dungeons, or wilderness and city areas? How will you generate interesting scenes and avoid logjams? Ideas:

- Find or create maps
- Find character art
- Write flashbacks
- Add details about the setting

> I'll use MT Black's *Iskandar City Sourcebook* sourcebook, which contains a lot of random tables. I might have to supplement using other city-oriented generators: 
> 
> - Tome of Adventure Design, starting from p267
> - Vornheim (might be a little off-the-wall, but worth a try)
> - (In Corpathium)[https://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/in-corpathium/] (again, never used it; looks weird)

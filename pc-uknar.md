## Background Feature

**Shelter of the Faithful**. As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to recieve free healing and care at a temple, shrine or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.

You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.

## Characteristics

**Personality Traits**: I've spent so long in the temple that I have little practical experience of dealing with people in the outside world.  
Also, I've enjoyed fine food, drink and high society among my temple's elite. Rough living grates on me.

**Ideal**: We must help bring about the changes the gods are constantly working in the world.

**Bond**: I will seek to preserve a sacred text that my enemies consider heretical and seek to destroy.

**Flaw**: I judge others harshly, and myself even more severely.

## Backstory
